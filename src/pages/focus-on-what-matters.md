## What Is Important?
In our world, timely accurate data is everything. Our processes ensure that data is collected and checked as soon as
it becomes available.

### Your Data
You can take advantage of our world-class ETL processes in order to capture and validate your own sources of data.
You can send data to the database using your own internal feeds or capture data from your own data vendors using your
own data subscriptions with those vendors.

### Your Processes
Build workflows and run them in the cloud to perform a variety of tasks like:
* Collecting and loading data (ETL)
* Building forward curves

### Your Time
Why spend time on tasks that can be easily automated in the cloud.
Moving your data management to OpenDataDSL allows you to focus on adding more important things that add value to your business.
