Euro Short Term Rate

## Overview

![](/img/data/ecb.png)

Euro short-term rate (€STR) is a reference rate for the currency euro. It  reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of banks located in the euro area. The €STR is calculated by the European Central Bank (ECB) and is based on the money market statistical reporting of the Eurosystem. The euro short-term rate (€STR) is published on each TARGET2 business day based on transactions conducted and settled on the previous TARGET2 business day (the reporting date “T”) with a maturity date of T+1 which are deemed to have been executed at arm’s length and thus reflect market rates in an unbiased way.The ECB published the €STR for the first time on 2 October 2019, reflecting trading activity on 1 October 2019.The working group on euro risk-free rates has recommended €STR as a replacement for the EMMI Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) as the Euro risk-free rate for all products and contracts.
