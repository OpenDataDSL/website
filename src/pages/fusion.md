## Above the Fold Description

In energy and commodity markets, time is money. Every hour spent debugging code, building curves, or reconciling trades is an hour not spent on strategic decisions that move your business forward.

Fusion brings six specialized AI assistants into one seamless experience, purpose-built for data professionals working with OpenDataDSL. Each question automatically routes to the right expert—whether you're modeling forward curves, optimizing MongoDB operations, or architecting real-time data pipelines. Every assistant maintains full context of your entire conversation, so you never repeat yourself. And when you need capabilities beyond the core six, you can create custom assistants trained on your proprietary processes.

From hours to minutes. From generic AI to domain expertise. From one-size-fits-all to tailored for your operations.

## The Challenge Section

### The Hidden Cost of Manual Data Work

Energy and commodity companies face relentless pressure to move faster with fewer resources. Yet data teams spend countless hours on tasks that don't directly generate value:

**The reality for most teams:**
- Senior analysts writing boilerplate code instead of analyzing markets
- Days lost to debugging and troubleshooting integration issues
- Knowledge silos creating bottlenecks when key people are unavailable
- Repetitive curve-building tasks consuming analyst capacity
- Manual reconciliation processes prone to errors and delays
- Proprietary workflows that generic AI tools can't understand

**Every hour saved is an hour returned to high-value strategic work.**

## Intelligent Routing

### The Right Expert for Every Question

Fusion doesn't just give you access to multiple specialists—it automatically routes each question to the right expert. As your conversation flows naturally from strategic planning to technical implementation, Fusion intelligently selects whether the General Assistant handles high-level strategy, the Code Assistant tackles your ODSL debugging, or the Curve Assistant optimizes your forward curve models.

Each specialist maintains full context of your entire conversation, so you never repeat yourself or lose the thread. It's like having a team of senior experts collaborating seamlessly on your behalf—each contributing their deep expertise exactly when needed, all while staying fully informed about your goals and constraints.

**One conversation. Multiple specialists. Zero context switching.**

---

## Custom Assistants & Tools

### Fusion Tailored to Your Operations

Every energy and commodity company has unique workflows that generic tools can't address—proprietary trade reconciliation processes, custom risk calculations, internal compliance checks, or specialized reporting requirements.

**Build Your Own AI Specialists**

Fusion's Custom Assistants feature lets you extend the platform with your own AI specialists trained on your specific procedures, connected to your internal systems and APIs:
