London, UK – 1st January 2026 – OpenDataDSL today announced the launch of Fusion AI, a groundbreaking artificial intelligence platform purpose-built for energy and commodity trading professionals. 

### What is Fusion AI?

Fusion delivers expert-level assistance across market analysis, curve building, operations management, and workflow automation through conversational AI interfaces designed specifically for the complexities of commodity markets.

Unlike generic AI tools, Fusion understands the specialized language, workflows, and challenges unique to energy trading. The platform features six specialized AI assistants—General, Analyse, Curve, Operations, Code, and Integrate—each trained in specific aspects of commodity trading operations, alongside autonomous AI agents that automate routine workflows 24/7.

"Energy traders and analysts shouldn't need to translate their domain expertise into generic AI prompts," said Colin Hartley, Founder of OpenDataDSL. "Fusion speaks the language of energy markets natively. When a trader asks about spark spreads, seasonal storage values, or forward curve construction, Fusion understands the nuance and context that generic AI platforms miss entirely."

### Collaborative Intelligence for Complex Markets
Fusion's breakthrough capability lies in how its specialized assistants collaborate. When faced with complex, multi-domain challenges, assistants automatically consult each other—the Curve Assistant might engage the Code Assistant to generate custom curve-building logic, while the Operations Assistant coordinates with the Integrate Assistant to automate data flows to external systems.

"We're seeing traders solve problems in minutes that previously required coordinating between quantitative analysts, operations specialists, and IT developers over days or weeks," Hartley noted. "The assistants work together the way expert teams do, but with immediate availability and perfect consistency."

Early adopters report dramatic efficiency gains. A European power trading firm reduced daily curve construction time from 3-4 hours to minutes through Fusion's conversational curve building. A commodity hedge fund eliminated 15-20 hours weekly of manual reporting by deploying Fusion's autonomous AI agents to handle routine operational workflows.

### Autonomous Operations Through AI Agents
Beyond conversational assistance, Fusion's AI agents provide autonomous workflow execution. Traders configure agents through natural language to handle recurring tasks—daily curve updates, data quality monitoring, portfolio valuation, alert generation, and system integration—without manual intervention.

"AI agents understand context and adapt to changing conditions," explained Hartley. "If settlement data typically arrives at 5pm but occasionally comes 15 minutes late, the agent waits appropriately rather than immediately alerting for a non-issue. It learns patterns and makes intelligent decisions about when to proceed, when to retry, and when to escalate to humans."

### Deep Platform Integration
Fusion integrates seamlessly with OpenDataDSL's comprehensive data management platform, giving AI assistants and agents access to market data catalogues, Smart Curves forward curve construction, and the ODSL domain-specific programming language.

This integration enables sophisticated workflows impossible with standalone AI tools. An analyst can ask Fusion to "build a natural gas curve, analyze storage economics, and set up daily monitoring"—a request that triggers curve construction, statistical analysis, and autonomous agent deployment through a single conversation.

### Custom Assistants for Proprietary Workflows
Organizations can create custom AI assistants tailored to their specific methodologies and workflows. Firms are building specialized assistants for emissions trading, LNG cargo optimization, regulatory compliance, and client-facing portfolio services—encoding institutional knowledge into AI tools that scale expertise across teams.

"Our proprietary curve-building methodology took years to develop," said a risk manager at a natural gas marketing firm using Fusion. "We've encoded it into a custom assistant that ensures everyone on the desk applies our methodology consistently, preserving our competitive advantage even as team members change."

### Addressing Industry Challenges
The energy and commodity trading industry faces mounting pressure to operate more efficiently while managing increasingly complex markets and regulatory requirements. Fusion addresses critical pain points:

* **Scarce Expertise:** Immediate access to specialist knowledge without hiring constraints
* **Operational Bottlenecks:** Automation of routine tasks freeing analysts for strategic work
* **Consistency Challenges:** Standardized methodologies applied uniformly across organizations
* **Scale Limitations:** Growing operations without proportional headcount increases
* **Knowledge Preservation:** Institutional expertise captured and accessible rather than locked in individual minds

### Market Response and Availability
Industry response to Fusion's beta program has driven rapid adoption. Trading firms, utilities, energy merchants, and commodity funds across Europe, North America, and Asia are deploying Fusion for applications ranging from daily curve construction to complex structured product analysis.

"We evaluated multiple AI platforms for trading operations," said the CTO of a commodity trading house. "Generic tools couldn't understand our domain. Fusion delivered value immediately because it was built specifically for what we do—energy and commodity trading."

Fusion AI is available now through OpenDataDSL's cloud platform, with flexible licensing for trading desks, analytics teams, and enterprise-wide deployments. Organizations can start with the six core assistants and expand to custom assistants and AI agents as workflows mature.
