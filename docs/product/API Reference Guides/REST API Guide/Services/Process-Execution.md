## Listing Process Executions

Here are some examples of REST queries you can use with the process execution service.

### Get a list of executions for a specific process
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?name=ECB_FX
```

### Get a list of executions for a process for a date range
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?name=ECB_FX
  &start=range(2021-07-19,2021-07-23)
```

### Get a list of executions that failed for a date range
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?status=failed
  &start=range(2021-07-19,2021-07-23)
```

## Running a Process

You can run a process by executing a POST method with a JSON body with a name property, e.g. to run the ECB_FX process:
```json
POST https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

{
    "name": "ECB_FX"
}
```

To pass parameters to the process, simply add these as properties under a ‘body’ property on the JSON in the body of the request, e.g.
```JSON
POST https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

{
    "name": "ECB_FX",
    "body": {
      "property1": "value"
    }
}
```
