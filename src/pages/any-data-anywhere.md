## Flexible Data Management
Create 'real-world' data structures, add geo-tagging and use machine-learning to enrich and automate your data.

### Data Structures
OpenDataDSL allows you to model your data using real-world dynamic structures that adapt as your needs for that data evolve. 
Eradicate the need to adapt your processes and reports to deal with rigid constraints.

### Geo-Tagging
Most of the data in our world of Energy and Commodities has some location attributes which, when added to the data,
allow you to utilise [Geo-Spatial queries](/docs/odsl/dm/geospatial) and mapping capabilities.

### Machine Learning
Categorising data, looking for patterns and forecasting are all vital to adding value on top of your data. 
Utilise our Machine Learning capabilities to train and automate models to enrich your data.
