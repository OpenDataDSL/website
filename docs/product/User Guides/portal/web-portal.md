## Accessing The Portal
You can access the web portal from the `Portal` link on this web site or by clicking [here](https://portal.opendatadsl.com/).

Once on the main portal page, you will need to Sign in by clicking the Blue Sign In button in the top right corner of the page.

Enter your company log-in details to gain access to the portal.

### First-time login 
If this is the first time you have logged into the Web Portal, you will be required to enter some additional information to get you onboarded as a client.
You will be presented with a number of Microsoft screens which will authenticate you against your own Active Directory and you may be asked to accept some permissions for the OpenDataDSL application.

Once authenticated, if you are the first person to log-in from your organisation, you will be asked for the name of your company.
You will then be asked for your own name and a few other details.
