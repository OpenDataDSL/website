Rescales a TimeSeries to a different calendar

#### Syntax
```js
ts = scale(input, calendar)
ts = scale(input, calendar, observed)
ts = scale(input, calendar, observed, distribution)
```

##### Observed
Observed relates to the way the value is recorded and can be one of the following:
* beginning
* end
* averaged
* summed
* high
* low
* delta
* none

##### Distribution
Distribution relates to the way a value is distributed across observations when you are scaling from lower to a higher frequency calendar and can be one of the following:
* constant
* linear
* cubic
