## What is OpenDataDSL?
OpenDataDSL is THE Data Management Programming Language - the tool that makes managing data easy!

The OpenDataDSL components and API's let you quickly and seamlessly build your own world-scale data management platform in the cloud.
We load any data that can be freely distributed and make it available to you - you can model, collect, load, check and report 
on any data you own or subscribe to using the same tools and user experience.
