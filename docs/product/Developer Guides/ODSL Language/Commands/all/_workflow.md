Create a workflow

#### Syntax
```js
varname = workflow IN "category"
  (comment)? 
  (actionInput|actionOutput)* 
  (actionExit)?
  workflowStart (phase|workflowEvent|NL|comment)*
end

workflowStart: WF_START
  workflowTransition
end
workflowBody: (workflowEvent|workflowAction|workflowGateway|workflowWorkflow)
workflowEvent: WF_EVENT varname AS "string"
  (assign|comment|returnstmt|workflowTransition)* 
end
workflowAction: WF_ACTION varname input
  (assign|comment|workflowTransition)* 
end
workflowGateway: WF_GATEWAY varname input
  (assign|comment|workflowTransition)* 
end
workflowWorkflow: WF_WORKFLOW varname input
  (assign|comment|workflowTransition)* 
end
workflowTransition: "name" -> connection

// Workflow phases
phase: phase "name" (retries INT)? (delay INT TIMEUNIT)? (then reschedule)? (external)?
  (statement|workflowBody)* 
end
reschedule: reschedule INT TIMEUNIT
fail: fail expression
abort: abort expression
```
#### Description

The configuration of a workflow is best done using the workflow GUI in the web portal (Not available yet), but it can also be done in OpenDataDSL code.

##### Anatomy of a workflow

A workflow has some input, output and exit configuration at the start - just like an action. The input information is passed in via a process or as an object if running the workflow manually.

###### Workflow Blocks

All workflows have building blocks in them:

*   WF_START - There must be exactly 1 of these, which indicates the start point and it only contains a transition which is the first workflow element that is called    
*   WF_ACTION - This is a block which configures a workflow [action](399736839.html). You can:    
    *   define the action transition routing, i.e. the route to take given the transition information when the action completes        
    *   assign the action input variables from the workflow input or any previous action outputs        
    *   run the action using the input variables        
*   WF_GATEWAY - This block configures a workflow [gateway](399736839.html). It is configured in the same way as an action block and is generally used to route workflows according to an expression    
*   WF_WORKFLOW - This block configured a sub-workflow, it is configured in the same way as an action - NOTE than any workflow can be used as a sub-workflow    
*   WF_EVENT - This is generally used as an end point of a workflow and is used to return the transition information back to the calling application.
    

###### Workflow Phase

A workflow can nest its WF_ACTION, WF_GATEWAY and WF_WORKFLOW blocks in a phase.

It is recommended that you use phases in a workflow for the following reasons:

*   It breaks a workflow into distinct sections which get reported in real-time whilst the workflow is executing    
*   It allows you to time sections of the workflow    
*   Each phase allows for custom configuration of retries, retry delay and rescheduling
    

#### Examples

```js
wf_xml_extract = workflow in "data-loaders"
    // Extract some data
    in url as Scalar
    exit "success", "failed"
    
    WF_START
        "ok" -> act_extract_xml
    end

    phase "EXTRACT"
        WF_ACTION act_extract_xml ai
            "ok" -> stopok
            "failed" -> stopfailed
            ai.url = input.url
            result = ${action:"#extract_xml"}.run(ai, output)    
        end
    end

    WF_EVENT stopok as "success"
        return "ok"
    end
    WF_EVENT stopfailed as "failed"
       return "failed"
    end
end
```

As a line-by-line breakdown of this workflow

1 . Define a workflow called wf_xml_extract in the category data-loaders
2 . Set a description for this workflow
3 . Define an input variable called url which is a [Scalar](Scalar)
4 . Define exit transitions for the workflow as success and failed
6 . Define the workflow start point
7 . Transition to the action named act\_extract\_xml (the transition name is ignored)
10 . Define a workflow phase called EXTRACT
11 . Define an action block called act\_extract\_xml with an input variable called ai
12 . Route the “ok” transition to stopok
13 . Route the “failed” transition to stopfailed
14 . Set the url on the action input to be the input url (passed in by the [process](Workflows-and-Processes))
15 . Run the #extract_xml action passing in the ai variable and the global output variable
19 . Define the stopok event as a success transition for the whole workflow
22 . Define the stopfailed event as a failed transition for the whole workflow
