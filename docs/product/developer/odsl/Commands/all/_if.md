Used to test a boolean condition and take appropriate actions

#### Syntax

if condition
  (statement)* 
(elseif condition (statement)*)* 
(else (statement)* )?
end
```
#### Description

The if statement is a control statement - it controls the flow of the application based on the value of a boolean condition. An if statement can have an multiple elseif blocks which will be sequentially checked to see if there condition is true and an optional else block of statements that execute if the if or elseif condition does not match.

#### Examples

A simple condition that checks the value of a variable
```js
if a==1
  print "a is 1"
end
```
A multiple condition if statement
```js
if a==1 and b>5
  a=b
end
```
An example of using an else block that will execute if a is something other than the value 1
```JS
if a==1
  a=a+1
else
  a=a-1
end
```
An example showing 2 if conditions (if and elseif) and a else block that will execute if either of the if conditions donâ€™t match
```js
if a==1
  a=a+1
elseif a>5
  a=a+10
else
  a=a-1
end
```
