### Access to pre-built data loaders

We build and provide loaders for lots of subscribed data.
You can add these loaders to your private database, configuring your own credentials .

If you want us to build you a loader that we don't currently have, simply email our [data team - data@opendatadsl.com](mailto:data@opendatadsl.com)
