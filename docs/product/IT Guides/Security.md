Detailed technical information on user authorization and access control

## Authorization

Users are authenticated using Azure AD for SSO. 
Simply log into Microsofts Azure Active Directory using your companies email address, if you are the first person from your company to log in, you will be asked to enter some information about your company first.

## Authentication

User authentication is the process of limiting what users can access according to the work they need to perform. Authentication is split into 2 functional parts, application and data roles.

### Application roles

Application roles determine the degree of access your users have when using various aspects of the application and services. Application roles are global and fixed. The following table shows all the application roles and what they allow/restrict:

### Data roles

Data roles determine what data (from the Object Service) a user can access. 
All public data is accessible by everyone, but your own private proprietary data can be secured using Azure Active Directory Groups that you assign users to.

#### Private data roles

Private data roles can be created by a company administrator or a user with the ‘data-role’ application role. 
Roles can be added to your private objects using the **_access** property on your object which should match the private role that has been defined.

You can assign an ‘ALL’ data role which allows access to all private data.
