## Introduction
The OpenDataDSL command line interface or CLI allows you to
* Run ODSL scripts from the command line
* Create an interactive session working with ODSL

## Getting Started
Download the installer for the CLI [using this link](https://odslinstaller.z6.web.core.windows.net/cli/odsl.application)

## Interactive Mode
To use the CLI in interactive mode, simply run the `odsl` command without any arguments.
When you see the ODSL prompt, type in your command, pressing enter will execute your command.

### Run odsl at a command prompt
```
odsl
```

### Options

|Option|Example|Description|
|-|-|-|
|--session|--session /temp/odsl.json|Loads in the variables from a previous session and saves the session at the end|

### Multi-line commands
If you want to enter multiple lines of commands, end each line with a `/`, then the next time you don't end the line with a `/` the entire set of commands will be executed.

Example:
```js
for i=1 to 10/
print i/
next
```

### Saving and reloading variables
You can use the --session option to automatically load and save session variables, but you can also do this manually.
You can utilise the [Memory Service](/docs/odsl/service/memory) to save and reload sessions, e.g.

#### Saving
```js
save ${memory:"/temp/session.json"}
```

#### Loading
```js
mem = ${memory:"/temp/session.json"}
```

### Finishing the session
To finish the session and exit back to the command prompt, press ctrl-c

## Script Mode
To run a script, simply pass the script path and name as an argument to the CLI.

For example if you have a script in the /temp directory called test.odsl, you can call:

```
odsl /temp/test.odsl
```
