How to sign up to OpenDataDSL
=======

## Signing up to OpenDataDSL is 3 easy steps...

1. Head over to the [Portal](https://dev-portal.opendatadsl.com/authentication/login) and log-in using your Azure Active 
Directory corporate credentials.
2. Fill in the name of your company
3. Fill in some details about yourself

That's it!

## No Azure AD? No Problem!
If your company doesn't use Azure Active Directory you can simply sign up for a free Azure AD [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/register-your-free-azure-active-directory-subscription)

## What now?
Now you have signed up, you can freely explore the OpenDataDSL Portal using your [free monthly allowance](pricing). When you are 
getting close to the end of your free allowance, we will let you know and request that you enter some payment details
into our payment partner site so that you can continue using our services.
