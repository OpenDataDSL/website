London, UK (June 6th 2025) OpenDataDSL releases a new feature - Application Extensions.

## What are extensions?

OpenDataDSL extensions are a collection of components which form some bespoke functionality that gets added to the Web Portal.

Here are some examples of functionality that extensions can provide:

* Portfolio Management - manage a group of instruments, trades and calculate profit and loss.
* Scenarios - create what-if scenarios experimenting with different strategies and market conditions.
* Machine Learning - integrate your data with Azure Machine Learning.
* Exports - Build export job configurations.
* Forms - Create custom data entry forms.
* Asset Management - Manage information about your assets and collect in-the-field maintenance information.

And many more - speak to us about your bespoke requirements.
