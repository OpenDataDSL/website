## Introduction
#### Welcome to the OpenDataDSL developer quickstart track!

Here you will start with the fundamentals of the ODSL programming language and quickly jump into the primary domain of this language - data management.

If you have programmed in other 2nd or 3rd generation languages at any level, you will easily grasp the core elements of the language, whilst appreciating the data management extensions.
