## 5\. Data Subject Requests

Solely to the extent that Customer is unable to access Customer Personal Data itself, and OpenDataDSL is legally permitted to do so, we will provide commercially reasonable assistance to Customer in responding to the Data Subject Request. To the extent legally permitted, Customer will be responsible for any costs arising from OpenDataDSL’s provision of such assistance, including any fees associated with the provision of additional functionality.

## 6\. Requests for Customer Personal Data

6.1. If we receive a valid and binding legal order (“**Request**”) from any governmental body (“**Requesting Party**”) for disclosure of Customer Personal Data, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to redirect the Requesting Party to seek that Customer Personal Data directly from Customer.

6.2. If, despite our efforts, we are compelled to disclose Customer Personal Data to a Requesting Party, we will:

(a) if legally permitted, promptly notify Customer of the Request to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If we are prohibited from notifying Customer, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of that prohibition;

(b) challenge any over-broad or inappropriate Request (including Requests that conflict with the law of the European Union); and

(c) disclose only the minimum amount of Customer Personal Data necessary to satisfy the Request.

## 7\. Cooperation

Taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to us, at your request and cost, OpenDataDSL will provide reasonable assistance to ensure compliance with the obligations under applicable Data Protection Law with respect to implementing appropriate security measures, personal data breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators, in each case solely related to processing of Customer Personal Data by OpenDataDSL.

## 8\. Customer Audit Rights

8.1. Upon Customer’s request, and subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in your OpenDataDSL Agreement, OpenDataDSL will make available to Customer (or Customer’s independent, third-party auditor) information regarding OpenDataDSL’s compliance with the security obligations set forth in this DPA in the form of third-party certifications and audits.

8.2. If that information is not sufficient to demonstrate our compliance with the security obligations in the DPA, you may contact OpenDataDSL in accordance with the notice provision of your OpenDataDSL Agreement to request an on-site audit of OpenDataDSL’s procedures relevant to the protection of Customer Personal Data, but only to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Law. Customer will reimburse OpenDataDSL for its reasonable costs associated with any such on-site audit. Before the commencement of any such on-site audit, Customer and OpenDataDSL will mutually agree upon the scope, timing, and duration of the audit.

## 9\. Data Transfers

9.1. **Data Deployment Locations.** Customer Personal Data will only be hosted in Western Europe unless the customer provides their own MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

When required by Data Protection Law, such transfers by Customer will be governed by the transfer mechanisms described in Section 9.3 below.

9.2. **Other Processing Locations.** You may choose to use certain optional features of the Cloud Services that require transfers of Customer Personal Data outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom. When required by Data Protection Law, such transfers will be governed by the transfer mechanisms described in Section 9.3 below.

9.3. **Transfer Mechanism.** Where the transfer of Customer Personal Data is from the EEA or the United Kingdom to a territory which has not been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data on the basis of Article 45 GDPR (or in the case of transfers from the United Kingdom, by the United Kingdom Government), OpenDataDSL agrees to process that Customer Personal Data in compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses of the third party.

## 10\. Return or Deletion of Data

Customer may retrieve or delete all Customer Personal Data upon expiration or termination of the OpenDataDSL Agreement. Upon termination of your OpenDataDSL Agreement or upon your request, OpenDataDSL will delete any Customer Personal Data not deleted by Customer, unless we are legally required to store the Customer Personal Data.
