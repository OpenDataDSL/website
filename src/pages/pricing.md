## Overview

OpenDataDSL is a SAAS (software as a service) product and has a simple pricing structure based on usage.

### Software Usage

There is no charge for the use of any of our software, you are only charged for using our services.

### Free Usage

Each pricing item optionally has a â€˜free usage amount' which is the amount of that item that you can use per month with no charge - the pricing of the item only comes into effect after you have used the free usage amount.

### Pricing Units

Each pricing item has a pricing unit which is the metric that is used to quantify the usage of that item, for example storage is measured in GB/hour.

## Detailed Pricing Information

### Storage

A storage metric is recorded every day at midnight for each data environment. The value in the metric represents the total number of bytes of disk space taken up by your data. The value for the month is calculated as the sum of all the day's storage * 24 hours which is then converted into GB/Hour.

### API Requests

Every API request made to the OpenDataDSL services is recorded. This includes requests made from the OpenDataDSL language, processes, direct REST API requests, the Excel Add-in and the Web Portal.

### Messages

This metric is simply the number of messages sent to one of your queues.

### Processes

Every process that runs has a process execution log that records and stores a metric about the length of time that the process took to run in milliseconds. These metrics are summed up and converted to hours.

### Subscriptions

This metric represents every fulfilled subscription.

## Support Levels and Pricing
