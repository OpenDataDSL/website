<hr/>

At the start of a project to build a data management system, or simply getting a data feed to feed into an internal system, there are generally 2 considerations to make:

![](/img/blog/buy-build.jpg)

The decision of whether to buy or build a data management solution for your project depends on several factors, including:

* **Requirements:** 
  > Determine what specific features and capabilities you need and if they are readily available in existing solutions.
* **Budget:** 
  > Consider the cost of purchasing a commercial solution versus the time and resources needed to develop your own solution.
* **Time to Rollout:** 
  > Evaluate if you can afford the time and resources required to build your own solution, or if you need a solution that is up and running quickly.
* **In-house Expertise:** 
  > Assess the expertise of your team to develop and maintain the solution, and the availability of external resources if required.
* **Integration:** 
  > Consider how the solution will integrate with other systems and tools in your technology stack.
* **Future Support & Maintenance:**
  > Who will fix/extend/maintain the system, who will manage data format or source changes, will anyone internally guarantee availability/performance/quality?

Ultimately, the decision to buy or build will depend on the specific needs of your project, budget, and organizational constraints. 
   
Both options have their pros and cons, the table below shows a comparison for a typical small to medium data management project:

|Feature|Buy|Build|
|-|-|-|
|**Time to rollout**|3-6 months|>12 months|
|**Cost**|+++++|+++|
|**Flexibility**|Low|High|
|**User Experience**|High|Low/Non-existent|
|**Developer and API access**|Medium|Low|
|**Documentation**|High|Low/Non-existent|
|**Upgrades**|3 monthly/annually|Intially Monthly then likely rarely|

## 3rd Option
There is a 3rd option that contains the best of both worlds!

:::tip Best of both worlds!
## Utilise pre-built components to rapidly build a data management system, whilst giving your users a professional user experience
:::

### The OpenDataDSL Way
OpenDataDSL is THE Data Management Programming Language specifically built for collecting, managing, using and reporting data.

Our vision is to give companies the tools required to build a world-scale data management system which you can 'white-label' to make it your own.

You can combine the flexibility and cost savings of building your own with the quality, durability and greater user 
experience of buying off-the-shelf.

### What do you get?
