### Previse Systems

At Previse Systems, we fundamentally reshape the way Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) software is designed, implemented and operated.

We offer a highly performant SaaS solution for European electricity, natural gas and certificates trading – combining modern software architecture with the latest available tools and technology.

As a conceptual innovation, we build on the notion of “community”, with an infrastructure for energy companies to leverage synergies through collaboration in the IT domain. The goal of this is simple: better software, faster and at lower cost.

We create software without any legacy burden. Our data structure follows accepted market standards, which drives easy and fast data migrations, and is also a core factor of strong system performance.

We develop software that is both optimised for today’s energy trading, and ready for the changes anticipated in the markets in the coming years.

With our open App Store, we have the solution to the classic question of “buy vs. build” by proposing an optimal equilibrium. For the development of individual, regional, or otherwise specific functionality, our App Store introduces a flexibility of choices and alternatives, as well as a speed of realisation not seen before in this industry.
With Previse Systems, energy companies are well equipped to master the challenges of a fast evolving environment.
