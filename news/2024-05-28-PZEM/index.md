London, UK (May 28th 2024) OpenDataDSL, a leading provider of commodity data management software, announced today that PZEM Energy Company has chosen OpenDataDSL for their SaaS Data Management Platform.

Following a competitive RFP process, PZEM selected OpenDataDSL to replace an incumbent, third-party application with the OpenDataDSL software platform, capable of providing a holistic and innovative approach to data collection, intelligence, and integration. Key criteria for the selection of OpenDataDSL were the product fit to meet PZEM’s current and future requirements and the responsiveness of OpenDataDSL.

Colin Hartley, CEO OpenDataDSL commented “The whole team at OpenDataDSL are delighted to win the confidence of such a major player in the industry in a long-term partnership for enterprise commodity data management. The implementation and support team from OpenDataDSL will work closely with the PZEM project team to ensure a successful project, ensuring a smooth transition from the incumbent system to a solution that can grow and expand to PZEM’s growing needs.

Anco Hoekstra, Chief Information Officer at PZEM commented “OpenDataDSL impressed us with its dynamic, modern appearance during our selection process and was able to assert itself against established competitors in the Data Management Platform market. 
The SaaS architecture of OpenDataDSL promises high scalability, security, availability and performance.”
