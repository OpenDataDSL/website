  <h2>Where Does the Vendor Stop and the Client Start?</h2>
  <p>This blog lays out the problems with legacy, locked-down data management technology and services.</p>
  <p>The solution is to use a true data management platform that empowers companies to create, enrich and extend their data experience with an extensible data management platform like <b>OpenDataDSL</b>.</p>

## Introduction
Traditionally, procuring a data management platform followed a familiar script:
* A fixed set of data sources was identified
* Integration paths were mapped out
* The vendor launched a project to bring everything into their ecosystem
* Your team tested the setup
* Ideally—the system went live.

### But post-launch?

#### New data
Every new data feed or integration kicked off another negotiation, another timeline, and another invoice. These mini-projects mirrored the original onboarding. You waited while the vendor built and delivered, then tested and accepted the results.

#### New features
The same applied to new features. Want a capability that didn’t already exist? You’d submit a request and wait for the vendor to decide whether it fit into the standard roadmap—or if it would cost extra. Then came prioritization, delays, and, too often, abandoned initiatives.

In this model, the vendor provides. The client consumes.
And the client can only consume what the vendor decides to offer.

## The Platform Shift
Recent development practices have changed the game. Today’s platforms are no longer static services—they’re ecosystems: a collection of tools, services, APIs, and infrastructure that allow innovation from all sides.

### Why does that matter?
Because platforms don’t just deliver value—they unlock it.
With the right tools, users aren’t stuck waiting for vendors. They become creators themselves, building new services, apps, or integrations that run on top of the platform.

* Imagine building a monitored, validated data feed in-house. 
* Publishing a tailored internal app. 
* Deploying a custom report dashboard for your team
  
#### All without a vendor in the loop.

## The Rise of the Sophisticated User
Modern enterprises aren’t just data consumers. They’re technically capable, cross-functional powerhouses.
Many business users are already proficient in tools like Python and use them to automate workflows or build bespoke analytics.
Give these users direct access to the data, APIs, and transformation tools they need, and they’ll accelerate your business. 

#### Faster iteration. More insight. Greater productivity—enterprise-wide.

## Where Does OpenDataDSL Fit In?
OpenDataDSL was built with this new model in mind—a cloud-native data platform designed to **ingest, curate, cleanse, transform, secure, and integrate** business-critical data intelligently, securely, and transparently.
At every step of the data lifecycle, robust tools put users in control. You gain visibility into data quality, completeness, readiness, and purpose—all enriched with contextual metadata, business calendars, standard transformations, and intuitive visualizations.
But we didn’t stop there.
We’ve developed a rich suite of **tools, APIs, and services** that empower users to create custom calculations, integrations, quality checks, reports, and dashboards—all within the platform.

#### And now, we’ve taken the next step:

## Custom Extensions

Think of them as apps—bespoke services built by you, using your data or market data, and deployed securely on our high-performance, autoscaling infrastructure.
These extensions can be shared with internal teams or external partners, enabling seamless collaboration—or simply making your team’s daily tasks faster, safer, and smarter.

## From Consumer to Creator
Our mission is simple: move beyond passive consumption.
With OpenDataDSL, you're not just managing data—you’re **creating value** with it.

### OpenDataDSL — Go Beyond the Basics.
