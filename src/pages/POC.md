# FREE Proof of Concept

A **FREE Proof of Concept (PoC)** offers several compelling benefits, especially if you are migrating from a legacy platform. 

What is included in a FREE Proof of Concept:
* Full access to the entire platform for up to 10 users
* Up to 3 end-to-end use cases which we will either implement or help you implement
* A dedicated customer support representative who will work with you at all times
* If you require specific licensable data loading, you must have the required license or arrange a trial access 

## Advantages
Here's a breakdown of the advantages:

### ✅ Risk-Free Evaluation
* **Low commitment**: You can assess the value and effectiveness of a solution without financial investment.
* **Test compatibility**: Ensure the proposed solution integrates well with your current systems and workflows.

### ✅ Informed Decision-Making
* **Real-world results**: A PoC gives you tangible data and outcomes rather than relying solely on vendor claims or theoretical benefits.
* **Stakeholder buy-in**: Demonstrating a working model can help convince internal stakeholders and decision-makers.

### ✅ Faster Time-to-Value
* **Quick setup**: Most PoCs are designed to deliver results within a short timeframe, helping you identify benefits early.
* **Accelerates deployment**: If successful, a PoC ideally leads directly into implementation, reducing delays.

### ✅ Customized Insights
* **Tailored scenarios**: The PoC is typically aligned with your specific use case, offering a clearer picture of how the solution addresses your needs.
* **Hands-on feedback**: Your team can interact with the solution and provide input, shaping the final implementation.

### ✅ Vendor Accountability
* **Performance proof**: We can demonstrate that our platform performs as promised.
* **Service quality check**: Evaluate our responsiveness, expertise, and support during the PoC.

### ✅ Cost Savings
* **Avoid sunk costs**: If the solution doesn’t meet your needs, you haven’t spent money unnecessarily.
* **Better ROI**: Choosing the right solution the first time leads to a more efficient and cost-effective long-term investment.

## When It's Especially Valuable
* You're comparing multiple vendors or solutions.
* You're introducing unfamiliar or complex technology.
* Budget or stakeholder approval hinges on demonstrated success.
