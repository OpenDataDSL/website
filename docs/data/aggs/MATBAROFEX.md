## Overview

Founded in 2019, Matba Rofex (https://www.matbarofex.com.ar/en/) was born from the merger of two markets with a centuries-old tradition in the trading of futures and options in Argentina, Mercado a Term de Buenos Aires SA and ROFEX SA. Matba Rofex offers negotiation tools to meet the needs of users in an area that ensures the free concurrence of supply and demand, and the formation of prices with absolute transparency.

MATba was founded in 1907. It was the first market to be established in Latin America. In its early history, it traded Futures contracts on agricultural commodities and rapidly became one of the main grain markets in the world. MATba is the largest agricultural futures & options exchange in South America. It trades futures (contract size 100 metric tons) and options (American style). Traded products include soybean, wheat, corn, sunflower, sorghum, barley, soybean oil and ICA MATba (Argentine Commodities Index).In January 2017 MATba signed an agreement with ROFEX to interconnect their trading platforms so members of both exchanges could trade all the products listed at both Exchanges. Later that year, cattle and "mini" contracts on wheat, soybeans and corn were launched. In October 2018 MATba and Rofex started a merger process.
