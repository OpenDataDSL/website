## Data Platform

OpenDataDSL are a cloud data platform that specialize in ingesting, curating, cleansing, transforming, securing and integrating business critical data securely, intelligently and transparently. At each stage of the data lifecycle robust tools allow those relying on the data to understand state, status, quality, completeness, readiness and fitness for purpose. Data without context is just numbers, at OpenDataDSL we add context – through rich metadata, calendars, transformations and a wide range of visualisations. 

To benefit from the investment you put into your business-critical data you need all the different types and sources of data presented in forms that are catalogued and optimized for a wide range of end uses – whether that is a downstream system, an algorithm, a data store or a human being. OpenDataDSL is designed and engineered to create useable data from multiple disparate sources and combine it into a single, organized data repository, accessed via a range of secure, performant APIs, apps and user interfaces. 

OpenDataDSL provides a comprehensive and centralized source of internal and external information, which can be used across an enterprise in multiple work streams and for multiple purposes such as research, back testing, business intelligence, ERP, data analytics, portfolio pricing or risk management. 

***There is no limitation.***
