## How Does It Work?
All the software that we provide is FREE to use, the only costs you will incur is when you use the Cloud Services, 
and even then we give you a generous FREE monthly allowance.

### Free Software
All of our software (Cloud Portal, Excel Add-in, VS Code Extension etc.) is FREE to use/download FOREVER! We will
never charge you for it! 

We also give you access to our GitHub repository with lots of examples, utilities and applications that you can 
freely download, clone and modify to use however you want.

### Free Data
All of the data in the OpenDataDSL `public source` is freely available data in the public domain or with unrestricted access that
we collect and make available to you for FREE.

You can use it in the Cloud Portal, Excel Add-in, API or download it and store it in your own database.

### Free Service Quota
Every month we give you a [free quota of Service Usage](pricing), if you never go above that quota you will never need to pay anything!
