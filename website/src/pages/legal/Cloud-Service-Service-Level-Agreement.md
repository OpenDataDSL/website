Cloud Service Service Level Agreement
=====================================================

The service level agreement we offer for our Cloud Services

_Last updated 9th July 2021_

OpenDataDSL will use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the availability of the Cloud Services, and provides performance standards as detailed below. This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) applies only to our Cloud Services and does not apply to any other product offered by OpenDataDSL. We will provide at least 90 days' advance notice for adverse changes to this SLA.

If we do not achieve and maintain the Monthly Uptime Percentages set forth in the table below, then you may be eligible for a Service Credit.

|**Monthly Uptime Percentage**|**Service Credit**|
|-|-|
|< 99.995% but equal to or greater than 99.0%|10%|
|< 99.0%|25%|
|< 95.0%|100%|

## Definitions

As used herein, "month" refers to a calendar month.

"Applicable Monthly Service Fees" means the total fees paid by you for use of our Cloud Services during the month in which Downtime occurred.

"Downtime" is calculated on a monthly basis and is the total number of minutes during the month that the Cloud Services was unavailable or your data was unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable if all of your continuous attempts to establish a connection to the Cloud Services within the minute fail. Downtime does not include partial minutes of unavailability or scheduled downtime for maintenance and upgrades.

"Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated on a monthly basis and is calculated as:

Any account used for only part of the month is assumed to be 100% available for the portion of the month that it is not used.

"Service Credit" is the percentage of the Applicable Monthly Service Fees to be credited to you if OpenDataDSL approves your claim, as set forth in the table above.
