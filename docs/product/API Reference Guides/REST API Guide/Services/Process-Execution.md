The API consists of the following calls:

|**Method**|**Path**|**Example**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|-|
|GET|||Get the build information for this service|
|GET|{release}|v1|List process executions|
|GET|{release}/{key}|v1/private/6090915ad6a48d0b3c4f663d|Retrieve a single process execution log using it’s unique id|
|POST|{release}|v1|Manually trigger a process, then JSON body of the post must have a name property which is the name of the process|

## Listing Process Executions

Here are some examples of REST queries you can use with the process execution service.

### Get a list of executions for a specific process
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?name=ECB_FX
```

### Get a list of executions for a process for a date range
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?name=ECB_FX
  &start=range(2021-07-19,2021-07-23)
```

### Get a list of executions that failed for a date range
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
  ?status=failed
  &start=range(2021-07-19,2021-07-23)
```

## Running a Process

You can run a process by executing a POST method with a JSON body with a name property, e.g. to run the ECB_FX process:
```json
POST https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

{
    "name": "ECB_FX"
}
```

To pass parameters to the process, simply add these as properties under a ‘body’ property on the JSON in the body of the request, e.g.
```JSON
POST https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/process-exec/v1
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

{
    "name": "ECB_FX",
    "body": {
      "property1": "value"
    }
}
```
