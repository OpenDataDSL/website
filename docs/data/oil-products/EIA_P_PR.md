## Overview

The **U.S. Energy Information Administration** (**EIA**) is a principal agency of the [U.S. Federal Statistical System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Statistical_System_of_the_United_States) responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment. EIA programs cover data on [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal), [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum), [natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas), [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power), [renewable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy) and [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power) energy.

EIA disseminates its data products, analyses, reports, and services to customers and stakeholders primarily through its website and the customer contact center.

Located in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C), EIA has about 325 federal employees and a budget of [$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$)126.8 million in fiscal year 2021
