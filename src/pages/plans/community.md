Our ```community``` code editor is a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension which has the following features:
* Syntax highlighting
* Code completion (IntelliSense)
* Problem highlighting
* Hover information
* Code snippets
* Region support
* Debug code
    * Breakpoints
    * Step through code
    * Examine variables
