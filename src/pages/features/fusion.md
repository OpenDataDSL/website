<Feature title="Fusion AI" slogan="Your AI expert for energy professionals" jpg="/img/icons/fusion.png" />

In energy and commodity markets, time is money. Every hour spent debugging code, building curves, or reconciling trades is an hour not spent on strategic decisions that move your business forward.

Fusion brings six specialized AI assistants into one seamless experience, purpose-built for data professionals working with OpenDataDSL. Each question automatically routes to the right expert—whether you're modeling forward curves, optimizing MongoDB operations, or architecting real-time data pipelines. Every assistant maintains full context of your entire conversation, so you never repeat yourself. And when you need capabilities beyond the core six, you can create custom assistants trained on your proprietary processes.

From hours to minutes. From generic AI to domain expertise. From one-size-fits-all to tailored for your operations.

## The Hidden Cost of Manual Data Work

Energy and commodity companies face relentless pressure to move faster with fewer resources. Yet data teams spend countless hours on tasks that don't directly generate value:

**The reality for most teams:**
- Senior analysts writing boilerplate code instead of analyzing markets
- Days lost to debugging and troubleshooting integration issues
- Knowledge silos creating bottlenecks when key people are unavailable
- Repetitive curve-building tasks consuming analyst capacity
- Manual reconciliation processes prone to errors and delays
- Proprietary workflows that generic AI tools can't understand

**Every hour saved is an hour returned to high-value strategic work.**

## What is Fusion?

### Specialized Intelligence for Energy & Commodity Data

Fusion is six expert AI assistants (plus your custom specialists) engineered specifically for OpenDataDSL professionals in energy and commodity markets:

* **General Assistant**
> Your strategic partner for planning, problem-solving, and navigating complex challenges across the platform.

* **Analyze Assistant**
> Deep data analysis, pattern recognition, and insights from your timeseries and market data—spot anomalies, validate data quality, and surface trends.

* **Curve Assistant**
> Forward curve modeling, curve construction, pricing algorithms, and market data expertise. Build and validate curves in minutes, not hours.

* **Operations Assistant**
> MongoDB operations, data pipeline optimization, system architecture, and infrastructure guidance. Keep your data infrastructure running at peak efficiency.

* **Code Assistant**
> ODSL code generation, debugging, optimization, and best practices. Your expert pair programmer who never takes a day off.

* **Integrate Assistant**
> API design, system integration, data flows, and connecting OpenDataDSL with ETRM systems, risk platforms, and your broader data ecosystem.

* **Your Custom Assistants**
> Trade reconciliation, compliance workflows, proprietary risk calculations, internal reporting—whatever your organization needs. Build specialists that understand your unique processes and connect to your systems.

Each assistant brings deep specialization. Together, they form a unified intelligence that understands your entire workflow.

## Intelligent Routing

### The Right Expert for Every Question

Fusion doesn't just give you access to multiple specialists—it automatically routes each question to the right expert. As your conversation flows naturally from strategic planning to technical implementation, Fusion intelligently selects whether the General Assistant handles high-level strategy, the Code Assistant tackles your ODSL debugging, or the Curve Assistant optimizes your forward curve models.

Each specialist maintains full context of your entire conversation, so you never repeat yourself or lose the thread. It's like having a team of senior experts collaborating seamlessly on your behalf—each contributing their deep expertise exactly when needed, all while staying fully informed about your goals and constraints.

**One conversation. Multiple specialists. Zero context switching.**

## Custom Assistants & Tools

### Fusion Tailored to Your Operations

Every energy and commodity company has unique workflows that generic tools can't address—proprietary trade reconciliation processes, custom risk calculations, internal compliance checks, or specialized reporting requirements.

**Build Your Own AI Specialists**

Fusion's Custom Assistants feature lets you extend the platform with your own AI specialists trained on your specific procedures, connected to your internal systems and APIs:

- **Trade Reconciliation Assistant** that understands your settlement rules and ETRM quirks
- **Compliance Assistant** that knows your internal approval workflows and regulatory obligations
- **Risk Calculation Assistant** that implements your proprietary VaR methodologies
- **Report Generation Assistant** that produces your specific management reports
- **Custom Integration Assistant** that connects to your legacy systems

**Seamless Integration**

Your custom assistants work alongside Fusion's six core specialists, accessing the same conversation context and intelligent routing. Deploy institutional knowledge that never leaves on vacation, never forgets a procedure, and scales across your entire organization.

**Turn Your Competitive Advantages into AI**

The workflows and domain expertise that differentiate your company can now be captured as AI-powered capabilities that your entire team can access instantly.

## Agents

Fusion agents are AI-powered specialists for energy and commodity professionals that automate complex workflows, generate code, analyze data, and integrate with your systems through natural conversation.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, Fusion agents understand the language of your industry—from ETRM systems and market data to REMIT compliance and curve building. They can generate OpenDataDSL code, analyze timeseries data, manage operations, and answer domain-specific questions with precision.

### How Fusion Agents Benefit Users

* **Accelerate daily workflows**
  > Tasks that once required navigating multiple systems, writing queries, and formatting reports now happen through natural conversation. Need to analyze forward curves, check process execution status, or generate ODSL scripts? Just ask.

* **Leverage your data intelligently**
  > Fusion agents work with your licensed market data and internal systems while respecting data boundaries and privacy. They provide insights based on current information, not generic responses.

* **Reduce technical barriers**
  > Team members who aren't data engineers can still accomplish sophisticated tasks. The agents translate business questions into technical operations—generating correct ODSL code, building complex queries, and managing data workflows.

* **Automate recurring tasks**
  > Refine an analysis or report through conversation until it's exactly what you need, then schedule it to run automatically. Daily status summaries, weekly market analysis, or exception alerts—all delivered without manual intervention.

* **Scale expertise**
  > Your team gains access to specialized knowledge across data management, market analysis, compliance, and operations—without hiring additional specialists or waiting for expert availability.
