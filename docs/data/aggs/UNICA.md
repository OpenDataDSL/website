UNICA (Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association) is the representative body of a wide group of companies that produce sugar, ethanol and bioelectricity in the Center-South region of Brazil.

Following sectorial deregulation in Brazil, in 1997 several sectoral organizations in the state of SÃ£o Paulo decided to merge. The association aims to promote and defend the interests of sugar, ethanol and bioelectricity producers, not only in Brazil but at a global scale.
