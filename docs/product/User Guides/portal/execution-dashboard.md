The execution dashboard is used to monitor process executions in real-time.
You can also drill-down into specific executions to check the correct flow and understand why and where they failed.

## Layout
The execution dashboard screen contains 3 distinct sections:
* Filter panel - used for filtering the process executions
* Filtered list - the process executions which match the filter
* Detail panel - details of the currently selected process execution

## Filter panel
The filter panel allows you to filter the process executions to the range and type of execution you want to focus on.

You can filter on the following:
* Time range - you can select all executions within the last:
  * 12 hours
  * 24 hours
  * 48 hours
  * Week
  * Month
* How the process was triggered
  * Scheduled
  * Manual
  * Event
* The status of the execution
  * Running
  * Success
  * Failed

:::note
The summary chart shows all the executions for the currently selected range only
:::

## Filtered list
The filtered list shows the process executions which match the currently selected filters.

Each item in the list contains the following information:
* The status of the execution represented by an icon
* The name of the process
* The service name of the process
* How the process was triggered
* The timestamp of when the process execution started
* The loader message of the process if it exists, otherwise the status message

*An example item from the list*

### Actions
#### Click on process execution item
When you click on an item in the list, the details of that process execution are shown in the detail panel.

#### Hover over process execution item, click on run button
Displays a process configuration dialog where you can amend the process configuration (if needed) and run the process.
:::note
Amending the configuration on this screen is only for that one manual run and not saved
:::

#### Hover over process execution item, click on copy button
Copies the process execution id into the clipboard

## Detail panel
The detail panel shows the full details of the currently selected process execution.

The detail panel is broken into 3 sections:
* Process execution details
* Phases
* Process details

### Process execution details
This section displays information about the process execution itself - the table below explains each item of information:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|Started|The timestamp of when the process execution actually started|
|Ended|The timestamp of when the process execution completed|
|Duration|The amount of time, in seconds, that the execution ran for|
|Status|The status of the process execution, if the process is complete, this is the final status|
|Trigger|How the process was triggered|
|Trigger time|If the process is scheduled, this is the timestamp of when it was scheduled to run|
|Reason|The reason why this process was executed|
|Message|The status message of this execution|
|Loader message|If this is an ETL process, this is details about what was loaded|

### Phases
This section breaks the process down into individual phases as determined by the workflow that has been run.

Each phase shows:
* The phase status
* Phase name
* Logging information
* Duration of the phase

*An example phases section*

Underneath the phases section is a button for you to show details about the TimeSeries and Curves that were updated during the process execution.

### Process details
This section shows information about the process:

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|Name|The name of the process|
|Description|A description of the process|
|Service|The service category of the process, e.g. ETL|
|Status|The status of the process, either enabled or disabled|
|Calendar|The calendar associated with the process, if any|
|Cron|The cron trigger expression used to schedule the process|
|Next run|The timestamp of when the next time this process will be run|
|Workflow|The name of the workflow that this process runs|
