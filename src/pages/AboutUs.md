OpenDataDSL is the data management programming language.

## What we do

### Data Aggregation
We are a data aggregator that collects data from multiple sources and combines it into a single, organized database. 
The aim is to provide a comprehensive and centralized source of information, which can be used for various purposes such as market research, business intelligence, data analytics, portfolio pricing etc. 

### Data Management and Governance Tools
Data governance refers to the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data employed in an organization. 
It involves establishing policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines for collecting, storing, using, and disposing of data. 
The goal of data governance is to ensure that data is trustworthy and supports the objectives of the organization while protecting it from risk. 
Data governance involves collaboration among stakeholders from various departments, including IT, legal, and business, to ensure that data is managed in a consistent, efficient, and effective manner.

### Automation
Through the use of our workflow tools, you can automate repetitive, manual tasks associated with managing, processing, and analyzing data. 
Our goal is to reduce the time and resources required to complete these tasks and to increase the accuracy and consistency of the data.
Data automation can improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of data management processes, enabling organizations to make better-informed decisions, respond to changes more quickly, and increase the value of their data assets.

## Meet The Company

### Our Story
After many years of building and using data management systems, we condensed all this knowledge and expertise into a domain specific 
language (DSL) which encapsulates all aspects of data management in a simple and intuitive way. 
The key advantage of using a DSL for data management is that it provides a specialized and efficient way to work with data, making it easier to perform complex data operations.

> ##### We are passionate about all aspects of data management and continue to build and improve our platform. 

### Our Vision
Our vision is to make high quality, flexible and low cost data modelling, management and reporting for all sizes of 
businesses and all types of markets.

> ##### We aim to make the world's freely available pricing and fundamental data more accessible. 

### Our Technology
As a cloud SAAS company, we leverage elastic scaling and serverless technology to provide high quality, 
high performance, world scale software and services.

> ##### We make it easier for clients to move their data and processes into the cloud.
