Curve Service
=============

The curve resource contains all your proprietary forward curve configurations

## Curve REST API

The Curve REST API is a full CRUD API allowing you to search and filter curve configurations as well as update, version and delete them. It is accessed through the following URL:
```json
https://api.opendatadsl.com/service/curve
```
The API consists of the following calls:

|**Method**|**Path**|**Example**|**Description**|
|-|-|-|-|
|GET|||Get the build information for this service|
|GET|{release}|v1|List all the curve configurations|
|GET|{release}/{key}|v1/TEST|Retrieve a single curve configuration using it’s unique id|
|GET|{release}/{key}/{version}|v1/TEST/1|Retrieve a version of a single curve configuration|
|GET|{release}/{key}/*|v1/TEST/*|Get a list of versions for a specific curve configuration|
|PUT|{release}/{key}/{version}/{tag}|v1/TEST/1/PROD|Tag a version with a name (which can be used instead of the version number when retrieving it)|
|POST|{release}|v1|Create or update a curve configuration, the curve configuration is the JSON body of the POST request|
|DELETE|{release}/{key}|v1/TEST|Rollback to the previous version of a curve configuration, if it is the only version then the configuration will be deleted|
|DELETE|{release}/{key}/{version}|v1/TEST/1|Delete a version of a curve configuration|
|DELETE|{release}/{key}/*|v1/TEST/*|Fully delete a curve configuration, including all versions|

## Entities
