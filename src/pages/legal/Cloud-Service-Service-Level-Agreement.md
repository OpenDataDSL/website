Cloud Service Service Level Agreement
=====================================================

The service level agreement we offer for our Cloud Services

_Last updated 19th April 2024_

OpenDataDSL will use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the availability of the Cloud Services, and provides performance standards as detailed below. This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) applies only to our Cloud Services and does not apply to any other product offered by OpenDataDSL. We will provide at least 90 days' advance notice for adverse changes to this SLA.

The OpenDataDSL uptime guarantee is **99.5%**, this equates to an unplanned downtime of approximately **3 1/2 hours per month**.

## Definitions

As used herein, "month" refers to a calendar month.

"Applicable Monthly Service Fees" means the total fees paid by you for use of our Cloud Services during the month in which Downtime occurred.

"Downtime" is calculated on a monthly basis and is the total number of minutes during the month that the Cloud Services was unavailable or your data was unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable if all of your continuous attempts to establish a connection to the Cloud Services within the minute fail. Downtime does not include partial minutes of unavailability or scheduled downtime for maintenance and upgrades.

"Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated on a monthly basis and is calculated as:

Any account used for only part of the month is assumed to be 100% available for the portion of the month that it is not used.

## Limitations

Downtime does not include, and you will not be eligible for a Service Credit for, any performance or availability issue that results from:

1.  Factors outside of our reasonable control, such as natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure at your site or between your site and the Cloud Services;
    
2.  Services, hardware, or software provided by a third party;
    
3.  Use of your password or equipment to access our network
    
4.  Your or any third party’s (a) improper use, scaling or configuration of the Cloud Services, or (b) failure to follow appropriate security practices; or
    
5.  OpenDataDSL’s Beta Offerings.
