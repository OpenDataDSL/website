## Overview

![](pathname://../../static/img/data/FRB-Logo.png)


Federal funds rate is the target interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at which commercial banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight.

FOMC sets a target federal funds rate eight times a year, based on prevailing economic conditions. The federal funds rate can influence short-term rates on consumer loans and credit cards as well as impact the stock market.

The Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) is calculated as the effective median interest rate of overnight federal funds transactions during the previous business day. It is published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
