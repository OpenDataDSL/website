### Introduction to FX Market

The world is becoming more interconnected every day. Businesses and individuals around the globe are increasingly conducting transactions that involve payments of one currency to another.

This is the foreign exchange market, sometimes referred to as the currency market, Forex or simply the FX market. The FX market is huge, global and very fragmented. FX transactions can be conducted by large global banks, regional broker or dealers and even small, unregulated boutiques.

The growth in exchange-traded and cleared FX products is due to the highly transparent nature of exchange-traded products and also the safety that is derived from central clearing and post-trade risk collateralization, which reduces counterparty risk. 

### Size of the FX Marketplace

The FX market is the largest and deepest capital market in world. It trades virtually around the clock, worldwide, every day.

### Identifying Currencies 

Currencies are identified using ISO 4217 Currency Codes. By 1973, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) established the three-letter codes for currencies we use today.

### Identifying Currencies

Ever wonder what it means when you see currency quotations like these?

The first currency in the quotation – in this case the euro – is represented by its three-letter symbol, EUR. This is known as the named or base currency.

The second currency – in this case the U.S. dollar, shown by its three-letter symbol, USD – is known as the terms or quote currency.

### American and European Terms

Currency pairs versus U.S. dollars tend to be quoted in one of two ways; in either American or European terms.

European terms do not limit or refer to just Europe-based currencies, but to any currency other than the USD. European terms mean the U.S. dollar sits in the base currency location and the other currency occupies the terms position.

For example, the Swiss franc trades in the spot market in European terms. It is quoted in USD/CHF convention. CHF is the three-letter symbol for the Swiss franc.

American terms are currency pairs where the quote convention places the USD in the terms location.

For example, the British pound trades in American terms in the futures market and is shown as GBP/USD. GBP is the three-letter symbol for the British pound.
