Secure!
==========================

![](/img/secure.jpg)

## Security You Already Use
OpenDataDSL is secured using Azure Active Directory - the gold standard for identity management, authentication and access control.

### Corporate Credentials
Use your own company identity to [authenticate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/overview-authentication) 
users in OpenDataDSL along with all the features implemented by your own security team, such as:
* Self-service password resets
* Multi-Factor authentication
* Passwordless authentication
* System users and secrets

### Application Access
Your own company security team can configure user access to all OpenDataDSL services using [Application Roles](/docs/product/IT%20Guides/Security#application-roles)

### Data Access
All public source data is open available to everyone in your company, but your proprietary data can be secured with [Data Roles](/docs/product/IT%20Guides/Security#data-roles)
using Azure Active Directory Security Groups.
