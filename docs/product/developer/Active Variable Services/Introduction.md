Introduction
============

Detailed information on Active Variables and the services used by them

Active variables are the defining feature of OpenDataDSL which allows the user to interact directly with the Data Management System through the use of a well-defined, simple to use variable construct.

In OpenDataDSL, active variables provide a way to interact with the database and services to help you collect, validate, manage and report on your data.

The syntax of an active variable is as follows:
```js
${service (:source)? }
${service: (source/)? id (:version)? (,option)* } (for range)?
```
Examples:
```js
actvar = ${action:"#name"}
save ${action:actvar}
tag ${action:actvar} as PROD
actvarprod = ${action:"#name":PROD}

objects = find ${object:public} where dataset == "BOE_FX"
```
