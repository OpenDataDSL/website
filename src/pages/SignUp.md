How to sign up to OpenDataDSL
=======

## Signing up to OpenDataDSL is 3 easy steps...

1. Head over to the [Portal](https://portal.opendatadsl.com/authentication/login) and log-in using your Azure Active 
Directory corporate credentials.
2. Fill in the name of your company
3. Fill in some details about yourself

That's it!

## No Azure AD? No Problem!
If your company doesn't use Azure Active Directory you can sign up for a free Azure AD [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/register-your-free-azure-active-directory-subscription)

If you don't or can't sign up for an Azure Active Directory, let us know by emailing **webmaster@opendatadsl.com** and we will figure something out for you

## What now?
Now you have signed up, you can freely explore the [OpenDataDSL Portal](https://doc.opendatadsl.com/docs/user/portal) 
and download the [Excel Add-in](https://doc.opendatadsl.com/docs/user/excel).

Check out the [documentation site](https://doc.opendatadsl.com/) to get started using the tools and the OpenDataDSL language
