<hr/>

At the start of a project to build a data management system, or simply getting a data feed to feed into an internal system, there are generally 2 considerations to make:

* Do we out-source the whole project to a company that has readily available software?
* Do we build something from scratch?
   
Both options have their pros and cons, but now there is a 3rd option that contains the best of both options!

:::tip Best of both worlds!
