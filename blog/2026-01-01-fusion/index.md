## Meet Fusion

<img src="/img/fusion/fusion_architecture.png" />

<hr/>

Fusion is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for energy and commodity professionals. Unlike general-purpose AI tools that require you to explain industry concepts and lack understanding of your specialized workflows, Fusion speaks your language from day one.

At its core, Fusion provides six specialized AI assistants, each an expert in a critical domain:

### Built-in Assistants

* **General**
  > Handles your everyday questions about the OpenDataDSL platform and general queries with context about your business and the energy markets.

* **Analyse** 
  > Dives deep into timeseries data and forward curves, identifying patterns, anomalies, and insights that might take hours to uncover manually.

* **Curve** 
  > Understands the nuances of forward curve construction, seasonality, and market dynamics that define commodity pricing.

* **Operations** 
  > Monitors processes, tracks executions, and helps you maintain operational excellence across your systems.

* **Code** 
  > Generates OpenDataDSL scripts with precision, translating your business requirements into correct, efficient code.

* **Integrate** 
  > Connects your ecosystem, helping you build and manage integrations across your technology stack.

### Built-in Tools

We have created many built-in tools to allow you to interact with the OpenDataDSL platform for:

* Finding data
* Retrieving curves and timeseries
* Creating SMART data
* Creating and saving ODSL (the OpenDataDSL 4GL language) scripts
* Generating reports from assistant responses
* Sending emails

Any many more - you can ask Fusion for the current list of available tools by asking:

> *What tools are available?*


## Beyond Generic AI

The difference between Fusion and general AI tools becomes apparent immediately. Ask a general AI assistant about ETRM systems, REMIT compliance, or basis risk management, and you'll spend time providing context and correcting misunderstandings. Fusion agents already understand these concepts because they're built with energy and commodity markets in mind.

Consider a typical morning workflow: checking overnight market movements, reviewing process execution status, analyzing unexpected deviations in your forward curves, and preparing summary reports for management. Traditionally, this might involve logging into multiple systems, running various queries, exporting data to spreadsheets, and manually compiling findings. With Fusion, you have a conversation.

> *"Show me overnight price movements for natural gas and flag any curves that deviated more than 5% from yesterday's close"* 

Questions like this become a simple request rather than a multi-system expedition. The Analyse and Curve assistants work together, pulling current data, performing the analysis, and presenting findings in the format you need.


### Custom Assistants

  </div>

<div className="col-md">
<h3>Intelligence That Fits Your Organization</h3>
<p>While Fusion's built-in assistants provide immediate value, the platform's real power emerges when you make it your own. Custom assistants let you encode your organization's unique expertise, methodologies, and workflows into permanent AI specialists.</p>
<p>Your UK power trading desk operates differently from your US natural gas team. Your monthly reconciliation process follows specific steps developed over years. Your compliance requirements reflect your particular regulatory environment. Custom assistants capture this institutional knowledge, making it accessible to your entire team through natural conversation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

These aren't just renamed versions of generic AI—they're specialists configured with your terminology, connected to your data sources, and aligned with your business processes. A "UK Power Trading" assistant knows your market conventions, understands your internal product codes, and follows your trading protocols.


### Custom Tools

  <div className="col-md">
    <img className="m-5" src="/img/fusion/custom_tools.png"/>
  </div>

<div className="col-md">
<h3>Your Data, Your Systems, Your Way</h3>
<p>Fusion connects to your world through custom tools—integrations you build that give agents direct access to your databases, APIs, and internal systems. Instead of manually exporting data for analysis or switching between applications to complete workflows, agents work within your technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>Need to check current positions in your ETRM system, compare them against market data from your licensed providers, and analyze the results? Custom tools make this seamless. The agent queries your systems, retrieves relevant data, and provides insights—all while respecting your security boundaries and data governance policies.</p>
  </div>
</div>

This integration capability transforms Fusion from a helpful assistant into a central nervous system for your operations. Custom tools don't just provide information; they take action. They can trigger workflows, update records, generate reports, and coordinate activities across your technology stack.

### Agents

  </div>

<div className="col-md">
<h3>Automate What Matters</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful aspect of Fusion isn't what it does once, but what it can do repeatedly without intervention. The platform's agent scheduler turns any successful interaction into an automated workflow.</p>

  </div>
</div>

That daily 6 AM summary of overnight process executions you've been manually compiling? Refine it through conversation with the Operations assistant until it's exactly what you need, then schedule it. Every morning at 6 AM, the agent runs the same analysis with current data and delivers the summary to your head of operations—no manual work required.

Weekly forward curve analysis comparing your portfolio to market benchmarks? Monthly compliance checks ensuring your reporting meets regulatory standards? Hourly monitoring for operational anomalies? All become automated tasks that run in the background, alerting you only when attention is needed.

The scheduler doesn't just replay static queries. Scheduled agents run with full intelligence, adapting to current conditions, handling edge cases, and applying the same reasoning you'd bring to the task manually. They execute with your permissions, accessing only the data and systems appropriate for their purpose.

## Intelligence That Learns Your Business

Fusion becomes more valuable over time. As you build custom assistants and tools, as you refine workflows and establish patterns, the platform becomes increasingly tailored to your organization. New team members gain immediate access to collective expertise. Complex processes become simple conversations. Tribal knowledge becomes institutionalized capability.

This isn't about replacing human expertise—it's about amplifying it. Your traders still make trading decisions. Your analysts still provide critical thinking. Your operations team still exercises judgment. But they do so with AI specialists handling routine workflows, surfacing relevant information, and automating repetitive tasks.

## Built for Your World

Energy and commodity markets present unique challenges: highly specialized terminology, complex data structures, strict regulatory requirements, and workflows that span multiple systems and data sources. General-purpose AI tools struggle in this environment because they lack domain knowledge and can't easily connect to your specialized infrastructure.

Fusion is purpose-built for this reality. It understands OpenDataDSL because it's designed to work with it. It comprehends forward curves because commodity markets are its focus. It integrates with your systems because that integration is fundamental to its architecture, not an afterthought.

The platform respects your data boundaries, maintains audit trails, and operates within your security framework. Licensed market data stays licensed. Internal data stays internal. Permissions and access controls work as they should.

## The Future of Energy Trading Operations

The energy and commodity trading industry has always adopted technology that provides genuine competitive advantage. From electronic trading to algorithmic execution to real-time risk management, successful firms embrace tools that enhance their capabilities.

AI represents the next evolution in this progression, but only when it's built for your world. Generic AI tools require too much translation, too much context, and too much manual integration. They're helpful for general tasks but fall short in specialized domains.

Fusion takes a different approach: deep domain expertise combined with organizational customization. Agents that understand your business from the start. Tools and integrations that connect to your reality. Automation that scales your expertise rather than replacing it.

## Getting Started

Fusion's six built-in assistants provide immediate value, handling common workflows and answering domain-specific questions from day one. As you use the platform, you'll discover opportunities to create custom assistants that capture your unique processes and build custom tools that integrate your systems.

The platform grows with your needs. Start simple with built-in capabilities, then expand as you identify high-value automation opportunities. Each custom assistant and tool you create makes Fusion more valuable to your entire organization.

Energy and commodity markets demand precision, expertise, and efficiency. Fusion delivers all three, packaged in a platform built specifically for your industry. It's not about making AI work in your world—it's about AI that's designed for your world from the ground up.
