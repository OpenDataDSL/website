<hr/>

At the start of a project to build a data management system, or simply getting a data feed to feed into an internal system, there are generally 2 considerations to make:

* Do we out-source the whole project to a company that has readily available software?
* Do we build something from scratch?
   
Both options have their pros and cons - let's examine them:

|Feature|Buy|Build|
|-|-|-|
|**Time to rollout**|3-6 months|>12 months|
|**Cost**|+++++|+++|
|**Flexibility**|Low|High|
|**User Experience**|High|Low/Non-existent|
|**Developer and API access**|Medium|Low|
|**Documentation**|High|Low/Non-existent|
|**Upgrades**|3 monthly/annually|Intially Monthly then likely rarely|

## 3rd Option
There is a 3rd option that contains the best of both worlds!

:::tip Best of both worlds!

* Define your own [data model](/any-data-anywhere) or extend ours to suit your own unique data
* Create powerful, user-friendly workflows to map out your business processes
