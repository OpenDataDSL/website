### [Read the blog](/blog/dataset-monitoring)

With Open Data DSL Data Monitoring,  you get unprecedented transparency of your data pipeline with real-time updates and insights for data consumers. 

* Completeness checks ensure that every dataset is complete,  no matter how complex the delivery schedule is. 
* Critical loading time frames help you track late and missing data. 
* Add your own quality checks to ensure every value is within your predefined thresholds and get alerts when those thresholds are breached.
* All operational and technical metrics are stored over time,  and custom Insight reports give valuable answers to your business. Delivery timings, completeness, quality scores and data usage metrics help you manage your business KPIs.
* Automated and curated alerts let you know when there are issues and what we are doing about it. Send those alerts to a Microsoft teams channel or trigger a JIRA automation
