Customise OpenDataDSL to make it your own
==========================

![](/img/customise.jpg)

## Customise
We want you to be as passionate about our software as we are, so we have incorporated features that will help you to 
embrace OpenDataDSL as your own software.

### Custom Domain
The Cloud Portal is accessed via https://portal.opendatadsl.com, but why not access it via your own custom domain,
something like `https://portal.mycompany.com`. This will be easier to remember and help you adopt the portal into
your own company.

### Custom Logo
As well as accessing the portal via you own domain, you can also have your own company or custom logo on the Portal
that will help to identify the Portal as your own.

### Custom Colour Scheme
Why not skin the Portal using your companies corporate colour scheme too?
