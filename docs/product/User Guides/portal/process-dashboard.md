The process dashboard is similar to the execution dashboard, but is focussed on the processes rather than the process executions.
It gives you vital summary information about the executions of a specific process.

## Layout
The process dashboard screen contains 3 sections
* Process list - the list of all your processes
* Configuration panel - configuration details for the currently selected process
* Executions panel - interactive panel showing details about all the executions of the currently selected process

## Process List
The process list section is a list of all your processes. 
You can use the search box to search for a specific process.

### Actions
#### Click on process
Clicking on a process shows details about that process in the configuration panel and executions that have happened in the executions panel

#### Hover over a process, click on run button
Displays a process configuration dialog where you can amend the process configuration (if needed) and run the process.
