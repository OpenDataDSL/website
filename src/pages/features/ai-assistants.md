		<h2>The Knowledge Challenge</h2>
		<div className="story_content">
			<div className="story_text">
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Energy and commodity trading demands specialized expertise across multiple domains. Your team needs to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Analyze complex market data and identify trading opportunities</li>
					<li>Build and validate forward curves with appropriate methodologies</li>
					<li>Manage operational workflows and troubleshoot data issues</li>
					<li>Write code for custom analytics and integrations</li>
					<li>Navigate API documentation and system configurations</li>
					<li>Understand platform capabilities and best practices</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Traditionally, this requires hiring scarce specialists, scheduling meetings with busy experts, or spending hours searching documentation. Questions go unanswered, decisions get delayed, and junior team members struggle without immediate support.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="story_text">
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>Fusion's AI Assistants provide instant expert assistance tailored specifically to energy and commodity trading operations.</p> 
				<p>Unlike generic AI tools that provide surface-level answers, Fusion's assistants understand energy market terminology, trading workflows, and the OpenDataDSL platform environment.</p>
				<p>Six specialized assistants deliver targeted expertise exactly when you need it—24/7 access to intelligent support that eliminates waiting and accelerates decision-making.</p>

		<div className="orange_grid">
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Instant Access to Specialist Expertise 24/7</h4>
                <h5>Eliminate waiting for scarce specialists. </h5>
				<p>Get immediate, expert-level answers to complex questions about market analysis, curve construction, operations management, coding, and system integration—any time, from anywhere. No scheduling meetings, no dependency on specific individuals, no delays. Your team in London, Singapore, and New York all have the same expert support without overlapping coverage requirements.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Collaborative Intelligence Across Domains</h4>
                <h5>Assistants work together to solve complex, multi-domain problems automatically.</h5>
				<p>When the Curve Assistant needs custom interpolation logic, it consults the Code Assistant. When the Analyse Assistant identifies optimization opportunities, it coordinates with the Operations Assistant to automate monitoring. Problems requiring expertise across curve building, analytics, coding, and operations get solved seamlessly in single conversations—no manual coordination between specialists required.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Dramatic Acceleration of Decision-Making</h4>
                <h5>Questions answered in seconds instead of hours or days. </h5>
				<p>What previously required research, documentation searches, consulting colleagues, or waiting for expert availability now happens conversationally and immediately. "Calculate the rolling correlation between German power and TTF gas"—done in seconds. "Build a coal curve with quality adjustments"—complete with methodology explanation. Analysis that took hours now takes minutes.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Consistent Methodology Across Your Organization</h4>
                <h5>Everyone applies the same analytical approaches and best practices.</h5>
				<p>Assistants ensure uniform application of curve-building techniques, analytical methods, and operational procedures—eliminating valuation disputes caused by different teams using different methodologies. New team members learn approved approaches from day one. Institutional knowledge remains consistent even as personnel change.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Scalable Expertise Without Headcount</h4>
                <h5>Expand operations, markets, and capabilities without proportional hiring.</h5>
				<p>Six specialized assistants deliver expert support across analysis, curve construction, operations, coding, integrations, and general guidance—capabilities that would otherwise require multiple full-time specialists. Enter new commodity markets, build sophisticated analytics, automate complex workflows—all without expanding your expert headcount or training budget.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="orange_item">
				<h4>Custom Assistants Encode Your Competitive Advantage</h4>
                <h5>Transform proprietary methodologies into scalable AI-powered tools. </h5>
				<p>Build custom assistants that embed your unique trading strategies, specialized analytical approaches, regulatory compliance procedures, or client service workflows.

		<h2>Creating Your Own Custom Assistants</h2>		
		<p>Beyond the six core assistants, OpenDataDSL enables you to create custom assistants tailored to your organization's specific workflows, proprietary methodologies, and unique expertise.</p>
		<div className="story_content">
			<div className="story_text">
				<h3>Why Build Custom Assistants?</h3>
				<p><b>Encode Institutional Knowledge:</b> Capture your firm's trading strategies, analytical approaches, and operational procedures in an AI assistant that can train new team members and ensure consistency.</p>
				<p><b>Specialized Domain Expertise:</b> Create assistants focused on specific markets, products, or workflows—a "Coal Trading Assistant" with deep knowledge of coal quality specifications and regional markets, or a "Compliance Assistant" that understands regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
				<p><b>Proprietary Methodologies:</b> Embed your competitive advantages—unique curve building techniques, risk modeling approaches, or valuation methodologies—in assistants that help your team apply them consistently.</p>
				<p><b>Client-Facing Tools:</b> Build assistants that external clients can use to interact with your data and services without exposing underlying complexity.</p>
			</div>
			<div className="story_text">
				<h3>How Custom Assistants Work</h3>
				<p>Custom assistants are built using the same underlying AI technology as Fusion's core six, but enhanced with:</p>
				<p><b>Custom Knowledge:</b> Upload your organization's documentation, trading guidelines, methodology papers, and procedural manuals. The assistant learns from these materials and references them when answering questions.</p>
				<p><b>Tool Integration:</b> Connect assistants to your proprietary tools, databases, and systems. An assistant can query your internal databases, execute your custom analytics, or interface with your specialized applications.</p>
				<p><b>Workflow Templates:</b> Define common workflows specific to your operations. An assistant can guide users through complex multi-step processes with interactive prompts and validation.</p>
				<p><b>Role-Based Behavior:</b> Configure assistants differently for different users—junior traders get educational guidance, while senior analysts receive advanced technical details.</p>
