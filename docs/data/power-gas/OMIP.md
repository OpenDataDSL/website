OMIP 

## Overview

![](/img/data/omip.jpg)

The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) is a joint initiative of the Portuguese and Spanish government with a view to the construction of a regional electricity market. With MIBEL coming into force, every consumer in the Iberian Peninsula was able to obtain electricity, under free competition, from any producer or seller operating in both Portugal and Spain.

Thus, the MIBEL wholesale market currently comprises:

*   A derivatives market (OMIP), where future electricity production and buying commitments are established. This market allows for a physical settlement (energy if delivered) or a financial settlement (compensation of monetary values underlying the trade). OMIP was established on 16 June 2003 and its creation was part of a common bilateral agreement  between the governments of Portugal and Spain. OMIP (Operador do Mercado Ibérico de Energia – Pólo Português, S.G.M.R., S.A.) is the MIBEL derivatives exchange
    
*   A spot market (OMEL), with a daily trading component (day-ahead market) and an intraday adjustment component (intraday market), in which electricity selling (production) and buying schedules are established for the day following the trade. OMI-Polo Español S.A. (OMIE) is regulated by an international agreement between Spain and Portugal and runs the spot power market in the Iberian Peninsula under the Spanish jurisdiction. OMI-Polo Español S.A. (OMIE) is the company responsible for managing the day-ahead and intraday spot electricity markets in Spain and Portugal. The firm also manages the billing and settlement for the energy purchased and sold in these markets.
