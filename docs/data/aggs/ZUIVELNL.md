## Overview

![](/img/data/zuivelnl.jpg)

ZuivelNL was founded on 7 January 2014 by LTO Nederland (LTO) and the Dutch Dairy Organization (NZO), as a chain organization of the dairy sector.

ZuivelNL is active in areas where cooperation between the links in the dairy chain leads to added value. The focus of the activities lies with a number of theme groups, which serve as a consultation and action platform for members and partner organizations in sub-areas. ZuivelNL's mission is to strengthen the Dutch dairy chain with respect for the environment and society.

The chain organization is the neutral point of contact for the dairy sector for the government and third parties. ZuivelNL is the platform where agreements about joint arrangements and financing are reached.
